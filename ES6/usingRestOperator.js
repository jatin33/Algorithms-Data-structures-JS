What is rest operator?
... is the rest operator(3 dots)

Why it is used?
 With the rest operator, you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. 
 These arguments are stored in an array like object that can be accessed later from inside the function.
 It is an array like object. Therefore performing some operations on “arguments” will give an error.
