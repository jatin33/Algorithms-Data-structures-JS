Just like a normal function, you can pass arguments into arrow functions.

// doubles input value and returns it
const doubler = (item) => item * 2;
You can pass more than one argument into arrow functions as well.

===========================
Task defined
Rewrite the myConcat function which appends contents of arr2 to arr1 so that the function uses arrow function syntax.
